Currently it's just pdfium that needs manual fetching of the source code.  Instructions below:

#POSIX:
# ------ building pdifum - this one needs some manual steps - these can be done before calling the script ---------------
# - Set up your Depot Tools (this can be one time, reuse it for other builds etc)
#      Follow these instructions to get the depot_tools: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/linux/build_instructions.md#Install
# - Then go to your 3rdParty/vcpkg folder, and run these commands in it to get the pdfium source:
#      export DEPOT_TOOLS=<<<<your depot_tools path>>>>
#      export PATH=$DEPOT_TOOLS;$PATH
#      mkdir pdfium
#      cd pdfium
#      gclient config --unmanaged https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium.git
#      gclient sync
#      cd pdfium
#      git checkout chromium/5247
#      cd ..
#      gclient sync --force
# - If using the latest Pdfium skip the branch checkout above.

# Windows:
# ------ building pdifum - this one needs some manual steps - these can be done before calling the script ---------------
# - Set up your Depot Tools (this can be one time, reuse it for other builds etc)
#      Follow these instructions to get the depot_tools (download .zip, extract all, set variable, run gclient):
#      https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md#install
#      and stop at the end of that sub-chapter.
# - Then change directory to your 3rdParty/vcpkg folder (make sure it is not a long path, or subst V: to it), and run these commands in it to get the pdfium source:
#      set DEPOT_TOOLS=<<<<your depot_tools path>>>>
#      set PATH=%DEPOT_TOOLS%;%PATH%
#      set DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN=0
#      mkdir pdfium
#      cd pdfium
#      gclient config --unmanaged https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium.git
#      gclient sync
#      cd pdfium
#      git checkout chromium/5247
#      cd ..
#      gclient sync --force
# - If using the latest Pdfium skip the branch checkout above.
# - If using the latest Pdfium, use at least VS2019.
